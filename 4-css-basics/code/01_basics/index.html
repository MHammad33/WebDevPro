		<h3>This is a simple HTML document to demonstrate CSS basics.</h3>
		<p class="description">
			CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML documents. It allows
			you to apply styles such as colors, fonts, and layouts to your web pages.
			In this example, we will explore some fundamental CSS concepts and how
			they can be applied to enhance the appearance of a webpage. CSS can be
			included in HTML documents in three ways: inline styles, internal styles,
			and external stylesheets. Each method has its own use cases and
			advantages.
