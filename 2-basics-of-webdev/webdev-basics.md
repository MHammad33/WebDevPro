### 🔌 How Do Devices Connect?

A simplified step-by-step flow:

1. **Your Device** → sends a request to open a website
2. **Router / ISP** → routes your request to the internet
3. **DNS (Domain Name System)** → translates website names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses
4. **Server** → receives the request and sends back the website files
5. **Your Browser** → displays the content
